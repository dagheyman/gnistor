It is time to leave Meta, right? Many people agree, but it is easier said than done: Through such popular services as Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, Meta’s roots have extended deep into our daily lives. Leaving Meta’s services will require some efforts - but doing it together as a movement can make it easier.

This is why we have invited digital security expert and online community organiser Maia Kahlke Lorentzen, to present a practical field guide on how to leave Meta - and stay connected in the process. Maia will give a talk on the problems with staying on Metta and present viable alternatives to, after which we will have time for a Q&A. Everyone is invited to join the event - let us join forces in alternative digital spaces!

This event is in collaboration with ABF.
