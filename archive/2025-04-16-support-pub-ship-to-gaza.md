★ SUPPORT PUB FOR SHIP TO GAZA ★

Smålands Nation invites all Palestine friends to a support pub for Ship to Gaza. 

Ship to Gaza is a party politically independent organization that was started in 2009. Their aim is practical solidarity with the people of Gaza. Their goal is to transport shipments of asked-for supplies from Sweden through different ports in Europe. Their latest trip started on the first of May 2024. 

During the pub there will be screen-printing (bring your own fabric), drinks, and even a live performance by none other than Wild Creek Classics!

All proceeds during the night will be donated to Ship to Gaza.
So bring your friends, family and most printable tshirt.
And as always: Free Palestine!!!!!!
