The anarchist book circle at Solidaria will have its next meeting at 18:00 on April 23. This time we will be discussing Parable of the Sower, by Octavia E. Butler. Its a speculative fiction book about a girl surviving the collapse created by climate change.

As always, you are very welcome to join even if it's your first time, and/or you have only read part of the book. Looking forward to see you!
